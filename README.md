# Addtochart

Write a Python procedure addtochart(chart,index,state) that ensures that chart[index] returns a list that contains state exactly once. The chart is a Python dictionary and index is a number. addtochart should return True if something was actually added, False otherwise. You may assume that chart[index] is a list.
